## üöÄ Installation

You can install this project locally as an "unpacked extension" in your browser.

1.  **Prepare the Files**:
    Create a folder (e.g., `github-chinese-plugin`) and place the following two files inside it:
    - `manifest.json` (as you provided)
    - `content.js` (the JavaScript file you are writing)

    The file structure should look like this:
    ```
    /github-chinese-plugin
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ content.js
    ```

2.  **Install in Your Browser**:

    - **For Google Chrome / Microsoft Edge**:
        1.  Enter `chrome://extensions` (Chrome) or `edge://extensions` (Edge) in the address bar and press Enter.
        2.  In the top-right corner of the page, toggle on **"Developer mode"**.
        3.  Click the **"Load unpacked"** button.
        4.  In the file selection window that appears, select the `github-chinese-plugin` folder you just created.
